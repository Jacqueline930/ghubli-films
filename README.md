# ghubli-films

## Description
  This is a page that will allow you to search for different types of movies
provided by Ghubli Studios.
One of the features implented is that the search bar will autocomplete once you
type a movie you want to search.

##Starting
  To start the project simply type in your shell/terminal:
    npm start
  The app will run on a 3000 host.
Also I am using a webpack configuration, in order to start it, please return:
  npm run react-dev

##Complications

  I was able to hit the API, and the search bar with autocomplete. Also the API
  results from Ghubli were successful. However, when I switch computers, I was
  not able to show the page in the local host 3000.

##Conclusion
  i had so much fun creating this app because playing with a different API was
interesting and were able to get all info. If you have any questions, feel free
to contact me at rjacqueline@gmail.com
